  <!-- This adds different primitive shapes and loads a YCB mustard bottle to
       the world as an example scene for testing purposes.  The goal is to
       exhaust different functionalities of rendering color, depth, and label
       images via a purposely designed scene with various rendering settings,
       e.g., a colored and textured version of each shape are added (if it is
       supported). -->
